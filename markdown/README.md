# delphi-markdown

Markdown Processor for Delphi. 

## Basic Information

This is a Pascal (Delphi) library that processes to markdown to HTML.
At present the following dialects of markdown are supported:

* The Daring Fireball dialect (see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (translated from https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark)

Wishlist: PEGDown (Github dialect), CommonMark

All you need to use the library is any unicode version of Delphi. To run the 
tests, you also need FastMemoryManager and the Jedi Code Library

## Using the Library

Create a TMarkdownProcessor (MarkdownProcessor.pas) of the dialect you want:

     var
       md : TMarkdownProcessor;
  
       md := TMarkdownProcessor.createDialect(mdDaringFireball)
  
Decide whether you want to allow active content

       md.UnSafe := true;
  
Note: you should only set this to true if you *need* to - active content can be a signficant safety/security issue.  
 
Generate HTML fragments from Markdown content:

       html := md.process(markdown); 
  
Note that the HTML returned is an HTML fragment, not a full HTML page.
